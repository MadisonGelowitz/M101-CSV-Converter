# M101-CSV-Converter
CSV Converter built for M101 clients.

This converter takes in a client's Etsy Orders CSV and then uses the client's Product List CSV to separate the Etsy Orders CSV into the appropriate CSV structure for Printex and Xlusion orders.

Built using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery with thanks to:
